## Hi, I'm Nao (I prefer Renate)!

✨ A Computer Science(Software Development) student at NUST, figuring it out one project (and one breakdown 😭) at a time<br/>
🎀 I like things that are clean, intentional, and actually make sense — in code and in life<br/>
🧠 Big on growth: discipline, consistency, and becoming more confident + articulate<br/>
📌 I’m building a portfolio that feels like me — practical, creative, and well put-together<br/>
📸 Outside of school I’m into photography, styling, journaling, music, and anything artsy honestly. Check out my [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/renaote/)!<br/>
